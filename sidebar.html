    <h1>How to use this spreadsheet</h1>
    <h2>Created by Court Cox for the Miami Herald</h2>
    <h3>If you have not already made your own copy of this spreadsheet, do so now. Don't work from the original spreadsheet.</h3>
    <p>This walkthrough explains the minimal amount you need to know to create housing affordability graphics for your
      county of interest. <br><br>
      For a more in depth explanation of how and why this works, please see the README file on the
      Github repository <a href="https://github.com/MiamiHerald/affordability-dashboard">here</a>.</p>
    <p>What you will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Datawrapper account</li>
      <li>Your Datawrapper access token</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Charts you'll get (open links for examples):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/jKuws/">How does this county compare to the rest of the state?</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/jcQ2y/">County overview: info table</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/01gCe/">Number of homes on the market on a typical day</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/nxHaq/">Typical Cost of Rent from Beginning to End of Year</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/HF3gQ/">Home Value Percent Change since January 2020</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Quick note: don't change any of the sheet names on this spreadsheet, or the script may not function as
      expected.<br>Now move onto step 2 (tab above).</p>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="step-two" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Duplicate the chart templates</h3>
    <p>Click each of the following links, then duplicate the charts. Write down the five-character chart ID for each new
      chart. You can find this is in step 4 (publish/embed) at the end of the sharing link. For example, if the sharing
      link is "https://www.datawrapper.de/_/nxHaq/," the chart ID is "nxHaq." You will need the chart IDs in the
      following steps.</p>
    <p>Duplicate charts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://app.datawrapper.de/river/_/jcQ2y">Overview table</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.datawrapper.de/river/_/nxHaq">Typical cost of rent from beginning to end of each year</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://app.datawrapper.de/river/_/jkuws">How did this county compare?</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.datawrapper.de/river/_/01gCe">Number of Homes on the Market on a Typical Day</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app.datawrapper.de/river/_/HF3gQ">Home Value Percent Change Since 2020</a></li>

    <h3>Set up the script to work with your Datawrapper charts</h3>
    <p>In order to keep the timestamps and other metadata updated on the charts, we're going to use the Datawrapper API.
      This is already set up for you, but in order to make it run through your own account, there are a few steps.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Generate a Datawrapper ID. <a href="https://developer.datawrapper.de/docs/getting-started">This article</a>
        will walk you through the steps. You can choose which permissions to give the token, but know that for our
        purposes, at minimum, you must select "read" and "write" for Chart, and you must select "read" for
        Visualization.</li>
      <li>On this spreadsheet, click Extensions (next to Tools in the same row as File). Then click Apps Script. This
        should open a script in a new tab.</li>
      <li>On the Apps Script page, you should be on Code.gs (under Files on the lefthand side). If not, navigate to
        Code.gs.</li>
      <li>Click run, and give the script the permissions it requests.</li>
      <li>Now navigate to dw-update.gs under Files.</li>
      <li>On line 4, replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with the Datawrapper token you just generated. The token should stay inside
        the quotation marks.</li>
      <li>Between lines 18-24, you will see a list of chart IDs. Replace the chart IDs with the corresponding IDs you
        wrote down for each of your charts. This is how the script will know which charts it's updating.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div id="step-four" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Select your county of interest</h3>
    <p>Follow these instructions carefully.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right now, you should be looking at a sheet tab called "this-spreadsheet." (Look in the lower lefthand corner
        of the screen to double check.)</li>
      <li style='background-color: #ffe599'>You'll select from a dropdown menu for the yellow cells.</li>
      <li style='background-color: #e6b8af'>Don't change the red cells.</li>
      <li style='background-color: #d9ead3'>You'll manually type into the green cells.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>B2: select the county of interest from the drop down menu.</li>

      <li>B3: select the state in which that county is located.</li>

      <li>B5: select the county of interest again. The spelling and capitalization are intentionally different,
        but this should be the same county you selected for B2.</li>

      <li>If you cannot find the county again in B5, rent data is not available for this county. Leave the cell blank.
      </li>

      <li>After you've selected the county in B5, the correct state abbreviation should populate in B6. If it is not
        correct, there may be multiple counties with the same name. In this case, re-select the county in B5. Try
        different ones until the state in B6 is correct.</li>

      <li>C2: type the way you want the county referred to in the graphics. For example, if B2 is "miami-dade,
        fl," you may want to use "Miami-Dade County" on first reference, or you may want to use "South Florida." This is
        up to you.</li>

      <li>D2: type the format for second reference. For example, second reference for "miami-dade, fl" may be
        "Miami." Second reference is used minimally in the graphics. You can put the same thing for second reference as
        you did for first reference if you don't want a different second reference. Don't, however, leave either cell
        (C2 or D2) blank.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="step-five" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Set a time trigger</h3>
    <p>Go back to the Apps Script page, or re-open it if you closed it. (Extensions > Apps Script)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the lefthand side of the screen, you should see five icons. Click the clock.</li>
      <li>Set a time-driven trigger for however often you want your charts to check for new data and update.</li>
    </ol>
